== Installation and Usage: ==
The installation is fairly simple and straightforward. If you have ever installed any WordPress plugin, then there is nothing new for you. First, you need to have WooCommerce installed and activated on your site. If you do not have WooCommerce installed and activated on your system, then the plugin will generate an error message as it requires WooCommerce to function properly.
 
== How does it work / functionality explained: ==
The license key work for both virtual and downloadable products. 
First of all, you need to activate the plugin if have not done so yet. After activation, it will create a sub-menu called “WC Serial Numbers” in WooCommerce and also create a new menu item in the admin bar top menu. Thus, it offers out of the box convenience of use and ensures the best user experience.
How to create a license key: You have to use the “add serial key manually” option to create new serial numbers and assign them with products. The license keys that you create are product specific. So, you need to create and associate license keys with all the licensable products individually. Your license pool may have pre-generated keys for a specific product, but they will not be applicable for other products. So, you have to create new license keys for each new product. When creating the keys, first you have to select the product, secondly select if the product has any variation, then add serial number, how many times do you want to use it and let your customer use it, and finally, the validity of your license keys.
Add license keys directly from the Products menu of WooCommerce: You can either add license keys while adding a new product or during editing a product. You will find a new option called “Serial Numbers” in the single product tab menu. Click on it and it will bring forward a checkbox called “Enable Serial Number for this Product”. You have to check this option to expand the available options of this magnificent plugin. Here you will get similar options that we have described above to create and assign new serial keys for a product.
Delivery Settings: Under this section, you will select options for sending and revoking serial number. Here you will find different options and select the appropriate option for you.
