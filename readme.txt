== Installation and Usage: ==
The installation is fairly simple and straightforward. If you have ever installed any WordPress plugin, then there is nothing new for you. First, you need to have WooCommerce installed and activated on your site. If you do not have WooCommerce installed and activated on your system, then the plugin will generate an error message as it requires WooCommerce to function properly.

== How does it work / functionality explained: ==
The license key work for both virtual and downloadable products. First of all, you need to activate the plugin if have not done so yet. After activation, it will create a sub-menu called “Serial Numbers” in your dashboard and also create a new menu item in the admin bar top menu. Thus, it offers out of the box convenience of use and ensures the best user experience.

== How to create a license key: == 
The user friendly design and features enable you to achieve anything with ease. Adding serial numbers is fairly easy. First, you have to select the product to assign the serial key. Then comes the option to add serial numbers. You can add any combination of numbers and or letters to make your secret key. You can input multiple lines as your secret key. Thirdly, you have to deal with the “Activation Limit”. This section is mostly applicable for software or game licenses. If you want to allow single activation per key then enter 1 here. If you want multiple activation then you are free to enter any number. We advise you to keep it blank if the product is not software. The “Validity” option comes up next. This field takes days as input so if you want your licenses key to be valid for one year then enter 365 days. You can add any number based on your preference. You should note that the count of days will start from the purchase date. Finally comes the “Expire Date”. Here you have to enter a date from the nice calendar section. License keys of your store will expire after if the “Expire Date” is crossed. They will not be assigned with any product after that date. Congratulation you have successfully learned the necessary steps to create license keys manually.

== Add license keys directly from the Products menu of WooCommerce: ==
You can either add license keys while adding a new product or during editing a product. You will find a new option called “Serial Numbers” in the single product tab menu if you check the option “Serial Number” from there. This will bring forward options to create or assign existing serial numbers with that product. Here you will get similar options that we have described above to create and assign new serial keys for a product.
